Hello, user.

This a project that I made in Java, as you look over the code, you'll noticed that some things could be better designed, 
and I perfectly know, but bare in mind that this was a college's project of a course.
So obviously some parts of the code look sketchy, but overall I tended to use good practices.

///// Description //////

The project consists of a store named "TecnoPlus", a shop about technological products, such as: computers, laptops,
phones, accesories, etc. The shop needed a system to be able to manage an inventory for their products, as well as inserting
and storing the products, sell them, show a report of both inventory and total sales made and restock the inventory.
